# RecipeApp

Full site: https://latania-recipeapp.netlify.app/. This is a responsive recipe app using the edamam recipe API. Uses HTML, CSS, and JS with axios for fetching API data. SASS/SCSS was used for styling structure. 

In addition to API skills, this site demonstrates my current skills with modals and dropdowns.

# What I Learned

For this project the main takeaway for me was how important functions and state are in creating an app. If I were to redo this project, I would probably use React, but I wanted to challenge myself to stick to just html, css and basic js after using the MERN stack for a while in other projects. 

This project highlighted the importance of DRY to me and how functions can help you accomplish that, there were a lot of sections in my JS code that required the same functionality. Additionally it was helpful exploring an API since my other projects with fetching data were from mongo databases that I created for the projects. I enjoyed this project because it challenged me to refine my basic html, css and js knowledge.
